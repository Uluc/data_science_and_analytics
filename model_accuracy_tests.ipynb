            "how ironic , as travolta seems to be describing his latest venture . \n",
            "swordfish is loud , violent and amoral . \n",
            "it has the audacity to justify murder and mayhem in the name of sustaining our way of life . \n",
            "and how does travolta's gabriel plan to do this ? \n",
            "by robbing billions from his own government and using the funds to out-terrorize terrorists . \n",
            "swordfish is a very cynical movie . \n",
            "it relies on an audience's perception of our leaders as ineffectual and duplicitous and on terrorists as non-human , faceless entities not worthy of compassion or consideration . \n",
            "the movie's plot is preposterous with enough illogical leaps that if the film ever slowed down , you'd actually see how ridiculous it all is . \n",
            "this is a live-action road runner cartoon , moving so quickly that it's over before you can catch your breath to ask any reasonable questions . \n",
            "the storyline revolves around super hacker stanley jobson ( hugh jackman ) , recruited by gabriel to crack the government's computer codes so gabriel can gather billions for his anti-terrorist campaign . \n",

            "stanley , though having served time in prison for hacking , is shown as a loving and caring father , forbidden by his ex to see his little girl . \n",
            "audience animosity is immediately created for his former spouse by showing her as a drinker and smoker who also sometimes stars in her new husband's adult films . \n",
            "thus when she is found murdered late in the movie , neither stanley nor his daughter are allowed any time to grieve . \n",
            "in fact , subconsciously , many in the audience are probably glad she was killed . \n",
            "then there is the sequence involving one of gabriel's henchman holding a gun to the head of stanley's daughter to coerce the hacker to download the key computer program for gabriel . \n",
